🎯 Problem Statement


In an online bookstore, books are organized into different categories like Fiction, Education, Science, etc.
Managing these categories efficiently is important.
This project implements a Category Tree using Data Structures in C to perform CRUD operations on book categories.



🌍 Real-Time Application


This system simulates how an online bookstore organizes books using hierarchical categories.


Example:


Books
├── Fiction
│   ├── Novel
│   └── Stories
├── Education
│   ├── Science
│   └── Math


🏗 Data Structure Used


Tree (General Tree)


Implemented using:



struct

Pointer-based representation (child & sibling)


🔁 Features (CRUD Operations)


Operation	Description

Create	Add new category

Read	Display category tree

Update	Modify category name

Delete	Remove category

Search	Find category

⚙️ Algorithm Explanation


➤ Add Category


Search parent node
Insert new node as child or sibling

➤ Search

Use recursive traversal (DFS)

➤ Update

Search node and modify name

➤ Delete

Remove node and free memory

➤ Display

Print tree structure with indentation

💻 Technologies Used


C Programming Language

GCC Compiler

Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc, free)

▶️ Compilation & Execution


gcc main.c -o project

./project

📊 Sample Output


1.Add Category

2.Delete Category
